Send real-time PCM audio (16-bit integer) to your device speakers, from your Flutter app!

## No Dependencies

FlutterPcmSound has zero dependencies besides Flutter, Android, iOS, and MacOS themselves.

## *Not* for Audio Files

Unlike other plugins, `flutter_pcm_sound` does *not* use audio files (For example: [sound_pool](https://pub.dev/packages/soundpool)).

Instead, `flutter_pcm_sound` is for apps that generate audio in realtime a few milliseconds before you hear it. For example, using [dart_melty_soundfont](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_melty_soundfont).

## Callback Based, For Real-Time Audio

In contrast to [raw_sound](https://pub.dev/packages/raw_sound), FlutterPcmSound uses a callback `setFeedCallback` to signal when to feed more samples.

You can lower the feed threshold using `setFeedThreshold` to achieve real time audio, or increase it to have a cushy buffer.

You can also manually `feed` whenever you like.

## ignore feed threshold

To monitor remaining samples in real-time, you can use `setFeedThreshold(-1)`.

We will invoke your callback ~100 times per second regardless of how many samples remain.

## Usage

```dart
// for testing purposes, a C-Major scale 
MajorScale scale = MajorScale(sampleRate: 44100, noteDuration: 0.25);

// invoked whenever we need to feed more samples to the platform
void onFeed(int remainingFrames) async {
    // you could use 'remainingFrames' to feed very precisely.
    // But here we just load a few thousand samples everytime we run low.
    List<int> frame = scale.generate(periods: 100);
    await FlutterPcmSound.feed(PcmArrayInt16.fromList(frame));
}

await FlutterPcmSound.setup(sampleRate: 44100, channelCount: 1);
await FlutterPcmSound.setFeedThreshold(8000); // feed when below 8000 queued frames
await FlutterPcmSound.setFeedCallback(onFeed);
await FlutterPcmSound.play();
```

## Other Functions

```dart
// suspend playback but does *not* clear queued samples
await FlutterPcmSound.pause();

// clears all queued samples
await FlutterPcmSound.clear();

// suspend playback & clear queued samples
await FlutterPcmSound.stop();

// get the current number of queued frames
int samples = await FlutterPcmSound.remainingFrames();
```
